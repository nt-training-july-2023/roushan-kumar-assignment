1. Simple
    Java is easy to learn.
    Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write,
    compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages. Java is 
    object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Secure
    Java provides strong Exception Handling mechanism which makes it more secure as 
    it does not allow to run the program until you rectify the error. Java provides 
    access modifier/access specifier like private, protected, public and default. 
    It helps in controlling the access of any member
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Portable
    Java programs are portable, which means that the same bytecode program can run on 
    any computer system that has a Java interpreter
    

4. Robust
    Java is robust because it utilizes strong memory management



5. Architecture-Neutral
    Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features

6. High performance
    Java offers high performance as it uses the JIT (Just In Time) compiler

7. Distributed
    Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. 
    RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications.

8. Dynamic
    Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since 
    it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. 
    Java programs can carry an extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run-time.
