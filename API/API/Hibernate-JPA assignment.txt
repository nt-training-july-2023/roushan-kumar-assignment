Create Spring Hibernate/JPA project which has following workings :

Write a API 
1. To store/create single and bulk inserts of Employee records in database.
2. fetch all employees from database.
3. fetch specific employee based on Id.
4. Update employee record.
5. Delete employee.

Consideration :
Use Spring boot OR Spring framework
Use JPA is prefrable but you can use Hibernate as well.
Use any database (You can use inmemory H2 DB as well)
All APIs should be in excutable state.
Create document for API url and its payload.
